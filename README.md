# Salesforce-Webhook-Invoicing
: Automatically generate invoices in InvoiceService for sales orders in Salesforce and update the Salesforce records with the invoice status.
- Key Components:
	- Salesforce Apex classes for REST callouts.
	- Custom Salesforce objects and fields.
	- External services for handling OAuth 2.0 authentication with InvoiceService.
	- Apex triggers to initiate REST callouts on record updates.
	- Named Credentials for secure API callouts.
	- Remote Site Settings to allow Salesforce to make callouts to InvoiceService.

** - Step 1: Define Salesforce Custom Objects and Fields
**
- Sales Order: A custom object that stores sales order data.
	- Fields: CustomerID, TotalAmount, OrderDate, InvoiceStatus (Pending, Sent, Paid)
- Invoice: A custom object to store invoice data returned from InvoiceService.
	- Fields: InvoiceID, SalesOrderID (relationship to Sales Order), Status, InvoiceURL

**Step 2: Configure External Services for OAuth 2.0
**
- Setup Named Credentials in Salesforce for secure API callouts to InvoiceService, configuring the URL, identity type (Per User or Named Principal), and Authentication Protocol (OAuth 2.0). You will need the client ID and client secret provided by InvoiceService.

**Step 3: Implement Apex Classes for REST Callouts
**


Finally: Secure the Integration

- Remote Site Settings: Add InvoiceService’s domain to Salesforce’s remote site settings to authorize callouts.
- Named Credentials: Use named credentials for handling the endpoint and authentication details securely.
